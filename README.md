# Northcoders News

Update (18th Feb 2019): Northcoders have recently decommissioned the API that this app hooks into so I'm currently fixing it. I've built a new API (hosted here: https://northcoders-news-tony-sian-api.herokuapp.com/api) and have got the front-page working. Just need to fix the article pages :)

In the terminal enter:

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/baboquivari/northcoders-news.git

and navigate to the following URL in your browser.
